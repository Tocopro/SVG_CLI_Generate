## Technologies


This project is made with Node.js v8, utilizing v8.2.4 (node packet manager) it also employs jest v29.5.0 (node packet manager) for
testing 

## Installation

1. Build the App from scratch by opening a file index.js in VS code

2. Install the node packet manager 

3.  Next, use the terminal to run the command node packet manager to install dependencies - developers may need to install inquirer and jest directly inquirer will be node packet manager install inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and node packet manager jest to install the latest version of jest.

4. Run the application within the index.js terminal by running node index.js

## Credits

Worked with some of my bootcamp colleagues and tutors to put it together.

## Usage
